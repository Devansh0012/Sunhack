# Drawer Slider

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/flxa/pen/nqRQbV](https://codepen.io/flxa/pen/nqRQbV).

Jordan Moore provided a nice looking solution for a slide-in top drawer here (http://www.jordanm.co.uk/lab/topdrawer). I pulled it apart so that the necessary bits could be easily ported over to other projects and made the drawer full screen so that I could use it for a feature flip book that slides over the top of other content.
